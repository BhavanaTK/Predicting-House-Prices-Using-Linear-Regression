# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Linear-Regression
📋 Overview

In this hands-on lab, I worked with the California Housing Dataset to build a linear regression model that predicts house prices. The project followed a real-world data science workflow, including data exploration, preparation, model training, and evaluation using both quantitative metrics and visual analysis.

🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, I was able to:

✅ Load, explore, and prepare real-world tabular data
✅ Select features using correlation analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✅ Train and evaluate a regression model
✅ Visualize and interpret model performance

🔍 Project Description

After performing EDA and correlation analysis, I selected key features and standardized the input data to improve model training. A linear regression model was then trained and evaluated on a held-out test set.

Model performance was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which quantifies the average squared difference between actual and predicted house values, providing a clear numerical measure of prediction error.

To complement the numerical evaluation, I used an Actual vs. Predicted House Values scatter plot as the final visualization. This plot visually compares true and predicted values, where points close to the diagonal line indicate accurate predictions and points farther away highlight prediction errors.

Together, the MSE metric and the final visualization provided both quantitative and visual insights into the model’s accuracy, helping to assess performance and identify opportunities for further improvement.
